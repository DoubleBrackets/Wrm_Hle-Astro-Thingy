Wrm_Hle Astro Thingy

Download and Unzip WindowsBuild.zip, run exe

Rogue-like space shooter, but with no upgrades :(

Map Generates procedurally, use Minimap in bottom right to see terrain

Left click to shoot, right click to launch rocket(Both consume energy)

WASD to move, consumes fuel

Enemies drop fuel + energy + health when taken down

Press P to restart(if rng no gud). There's a delay, so don't spam it.

Reach the warp hole to advance

The edges of the maps don't generate yet, so don't go there :(

Made for Virtual Codeday Winter 2021
